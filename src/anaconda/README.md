# The Anaconda Image

This is an Anaconda image, using [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

Anaconda provides many Python packages that run together
in one Python environment, including [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).  It is the easiest way to install a wide
range of scientific tools into a single location. It also provides non\-Python software such as [Octave](https://octave.org/) and [Pari](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/).

It is very easy to install any packages you may need. Open a "Linux Terminal", select your compute server and type:

```sh
conda install packagename
```

Pretty much any scientific package you can think of is available! Search at [https://conda\-forge.org/packages/](https://conda-forge.org/packages/) .   E.g., you can install pytorch, tensorflow and sage all in the same environment with an easy `conda install` command!
