# The Anaconda Image

This is an Anaconda based Python environment, based on Miniforge, using [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) \(a self contained very faster rewrite of the conda package manager\).

Anaconda provides many Python packages that run together
in one Python environment, including [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/).  It is the easiest way to use a wide
range of scientific Python tools.

It is very easy to install any missing packages you may need.

```sh
conda install packagename
```

Pretty much any scientific package you can think of is available! Search at https://anaconda.org/

To install packages open a "Linux Terminal" and select your compute server.
