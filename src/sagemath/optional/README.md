SageMath with a lot of optional packages also installed into it, but with an attempt to still keep things small and distributable.

We include every optional package that makes any sense at all that we could install. Anything commented out in the Dockerfile is broken, and fails to install. Yes, it is weird that so many of the optional sage packages seem to be broken...
